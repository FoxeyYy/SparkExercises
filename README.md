## Log parser
For a any given file with log records like:

_10.223.157.186 - - [15/Jul/2009:14:58:59 -0700] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 403 202_

It first filters those whose status code isn't 2XX.

Then we count the number of requests for each URL.
Then we count number of request for each month for year 2010.
Finally the count of requests for each hour for year 2010.

## Friends recommender

_ID \t ID1,ID2,...,IDn_

We suggest a top 10 of users for each user who aren't already friend and ordered by their number of friends in common and their IDs.

## Bakery
Given a dataset which consists of the following files:

   - customers.csv : information about the bakery's customers
   - goods.csv     : information about the baked goods offered for sale by the bakery
   - items.csv     : itemized reciept infromation for purchases
   - reciepts.csv  : general reciept information for purchases

We count the total amount of money spent by each user, which users have bought more than once per day and the list of those dates and for each product the total number of units sold.

## Bakery

_Product1,Product2,...,Productn_

We build a list of association rules filtered by their support & confidence. Those rules are of order 2 & 3.
